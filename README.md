# Chariteer

Chariteer is the platform where talented volunteers meet impactful charities.
The Chariteer website has a lot to offer (Stay tuned from Chariteer team's creation)

## Here are some of the features

![Landing page](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1248/format:webp/1*nCZjUg_lskMDb6jKL1LR4A.png)

- On the landing page, there will be buttons for you to choose ‘I’m a volunteer’ or ‘I work in a charity’.

- There will also be a search bar empowered with search tags as promtps to narrow down the the skillsets you would like the volunteer to provide(for the charity) and new activities to try out(for the volunteer). 

- The notification machenism will be triggered to inform new volunteer with relevant skills/relevant charity (This can be in-app messages or as an email)

- An integrated check in/check out system. This is to match the need with the appropriate amount of resources whether it be human or materials

- Embeded Google Calendar to help charities broadcast opportunities and to help volunteers plan their visits

- Feedback/review system from all public - you can Upvotes / downvotes / Comments on specific topics, events or skills provided -> This not only help us navigate where the most help is needed but also provide a great way to help us recognise the great effort made by volunteers (This feature will likely be available after the alpha version is out)
